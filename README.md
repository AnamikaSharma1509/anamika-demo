# anamika-demo
This is my first project using HTML, where I recreated the Amazon Navbar.<br> 
The primary goal of this project was to understand the basics of GitHubâ€”how it works, how to connect it with a code editor like VS Code, and how version control operates. <br>
Additionally, it helped me get hands-on experience with front-end development and deepen my understanding of structuring web page elements.
